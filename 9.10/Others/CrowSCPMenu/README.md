The SCP Menu is a custom pak that allows you chose a skin or backbling ingame.

Once ingame, open the pause menu and look for the info button.
You can equip any skin or backbling, and favoriting them works too.
Switch Panel will choose between skins or backblings, and Toggle Favorite will toggle if it's favorited or not. The menu also supports custom IDs! Click on Reset to reload the cosmetic list to get additional items to show up. (This will wipe any favorited items.)

Note that styles are not supported and idk if I'll ever add them.

9.10 is the only version supported currently. Thanks to TI93 for some additional help with getting SCP to work. Controller UI is fully supported and Mobile should work too but it's untested.

(This will only work on servers that have ServerChoosePart enabled)
